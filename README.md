I bought an Apartment at 7 Liguanea Avenue in St. Andrew, Jamaica. I would like to enter into a lease agreement with prospective tennants and therfore would like to create a website to show it to possible tennants anywhere in the World.The website should be responsive, accessible and beautiful with modern features. There should be a landing page, a Gallery, a contact page and a page with a downloadable sample lease agreement.
